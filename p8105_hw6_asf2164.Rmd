## Problem 2

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dplyr)

homicide_df =
  read_csv("Data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city = str_c(city,", ")) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste0(city, state)) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%  
 filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>% 
 mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
  
```

```{r}
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  mutate(resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>% 
  select(resolved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
  
baltimore_fit_logistic = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

baltimore_fit_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), CI = confint(baltimore_fit_logistic)) %>% 
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
